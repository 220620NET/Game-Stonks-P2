# GameStonks S&L

## <b>Overview</b>

Like Fantasy Football but players invest in cryptocurrencies with the richest player at the end winning the game.
# We invite the rest of the class to play and the game ends at the end of the cohort
- **We publish the app so they can follow their investments and make changes on their own devices at any time**
- **Leaderboard, just to make players more competitive**
