Anyone with this link can view the GoogleSheet created for research
[CryptoCurrencies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g89Ff73dMfdmnEpg14zOlsZ6aUmj5jrJpAWtjGMAZOk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Contents
- **Table Info** - potential column names with some content
Really, that first page (and only 3-4 of the columns) are all we need

## Research done but not needed:
- **APIs** - plan details, creds, APIkeyes, links to documentation
- **API Data Access** - Data available with free plan
- **API Access (endpoints?)** -- for use with query strings?
